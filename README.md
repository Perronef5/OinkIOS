## Inspiration
Millions of people are transferring money each day using platforms such as cash app etc. We wanted to create a new platform that provided a safe and simple way for people to transfer their money in order to save it.  Anybody growing up had a piggy bank at least one time in their lives and thats when we thought of developing Oink. Oink is a new and exciting platform for saving money, taking the same concepts of a piggy bank. You can deposit money and break the piggy bank (transferring the saved funds) everywhere and anywhere you are, making it convenient for everyone.

## What it does
Our team has developed a full platform and robust offering for saving money everywhere and anywhere. Oink is available with almost every bank in the nation. Just like a your regular piggy bank, you can deposit money any quantity, until one day you reach your goal and decide to return all the saved funds to your bank account. 

## The Process
This is the first time we've ever tried to really plan out the user interface and user experience of an application. We created some on-paper wireframes of our vision based on the goals we identified for a user, and how they might want to use the app.

### Our paper wireframes for the Oink app

After creating wireframes, we validated them and re-created our layout for building the mobile application in Sketch and Adobe Illustrator.

### Our software-created UI prototype

## The Technology
**The Oink iOS app** 
Developed in xcode using swift 4, lottie-iOS, and plaid-iOS. 

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting it with the API and running live accounts properly. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The UI/UX and app functionally.

## What we learned
How to use the plaid API.

## What's next for Oink 
We would like to get in contact with banks to allow an easier and less costly way for users to transfer their money from their checking to their savings to make Oink a more seamless streamline product. Maybe one day we may have banks have their own separate piggy bank account exclusively powered by Oink :)
